## Motivation
Now Hosted: Click [SlapFace](https://slapeface.netlify.app) to visit the website.

<p>
Our team wants to build a website which can store different resumes from different disciplines. For those who already have an outstanding resume, they can upload it to the website to help others.
And those who are building their resumes can use the website to learn how to build a good resume.
</P> 
<p>
Resume show is a website which allows users to upload their resumes for advice or other uses. Users can post their resumes to the website and view other people’s resumes. Each
resume will have a section for users to comment and upvote.
